# Functions-with-Vectors
This program is a continuation of the previous 'Vector Operation' repo. Numbers are no longer hard coded, and, instead, take user input before a given computation. 

This project was useful in teaching me how functions in C work, how to use the #ifindef directive, and the importance of header files in the creation of organized/clean code. 

Possible operations: vector addtion, scalar product, finding the dot product, finding a vector's magnitude, finding the projection vector, and finding two vectors' cross product

Sample Outputs:


//Magnitude Example 


What vector operation would you like to perform?

a: Add two vectors (2x2)

b: Scalar multiplication + vector addtion (3x2)

c: Find the dot product (3x2)

d: Find a vector's magnitude (3x1)

e: Find the projection of two vectors (2x2)

f: Find the cross product of two vectors (3x2)

d

Please enter a 3 number matrix: (ex. 1.1 2.2 3.3)

1.1 2.2 3.3

The magnitude of you vector is: 4.115823


//Finding the projection of one vector onto another 

e

Please enter two numbers for the first matrix: (ex. 5.4 3.4)

1.1 2.2

Please enter two numbers for the second matrix: (ex. 7.9 3.8)

3.3 4.4

Projection Vector: <1.452000, 1.936000>
